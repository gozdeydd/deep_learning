# Deep Learning Practices.

I have did these notebooks for my Deep Learning Course in Master of Data Science in CUNEF.

In order to create a local environment to run these notebooks 'requierements.txt' file should be called in the environment with below command.

pip install requirements.txt

There are 2 notebooks that are currently in this repository. Repository named "Practica 2" I have used LSTM nets to try to find time series values by using a customized loss funcion. The red has 2 outputs,  one for sign and one for the value.

The second notebook "Practica 3" is a practice of CNN. Here I implement several methods to get rid of overfitting problem. As data CIFAR100 datset is used. 



My work can be used by humans for training purposes.
